# UltraChat - AI Orchestrator

## Overview

UltraChat is a production-grade, multi-agent AI orchestrator that provides advanced conversational AI capabilities with tool calling, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), secure code execution, and comprehensive system management. The application serves as an intelligent intermediary that routes conversations between specialized AI agents, executes code safely in sandboxed environments, performs web searches, manages document knowledge bases, and provides real-time monitoring and administration capabilities.
